# Cervical Cancer Prediction Using XGBoost

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of cervical cancer using the **XGBoost algorithm**. The dataset used contains various risk factors associated with cervical cancer, and the model aims to classify whether an individual is at risk or not.

## About this Project
In this hands-on project, we build and train an **XGBoost classifier** to predict whether a person has a risk of developing cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a serious health issue, causing about **4,000 deaths in the U.S.** and **300,000 deaths worldwide** annually. 

The dataset consists of **858 patient records**, including features such as:
- Number of pregnancies
- Smoking habits
- History of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)
- Demographics
- Historical medical records

Studies indicate that factors such as **high sexual activity, Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), hormonal contraceptives, multiple childbirths, and smoking** significantly increase the risk of cervical cancer. Women with **weakened immune systems (HIV/AIDS)** also have a higher risk of HPV, which contributes to the development of cervical cancer.

## Project Motivation
This project was initially inspired by a **Coursera-guided project** by **Ryan Ahmed** but has been significantly modified with additional challenges, optimizations, and unique implementations. The final code is entirely different from the guided project and incorporates multiple enhancements for improved performance and accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical insights and visualizations to understand the dataset.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying key risk factors contributing to cervical cancer.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Using **XGBoost**, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating model performance.
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data manipulation & analysis)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Feature selection, model evaluation)
- **XGBoost** (Machine learning model)
